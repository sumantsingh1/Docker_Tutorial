### Docker
```sh
Docker is free and  open-source project 
It is a containerization tool
It is used to build images and run containers.
It packages the OS, application and dependency together
It  automates the deployment of applications as a container
```
### Advantages over virtual machine
```sh
1. Faster Boot Time: Containers can start in seconds (or even milliseconds)
because they donâ€™t need to boot an entire OS. In contrast, VMs take minutes
to boot up since each VM has its own OS.

2. Lightweight: Docker containers share the host OS kernel, allowing multiple containers
to run on a single host without the overhead of a full OS for each instance. This makes
 containers much lighter in terms of both memory and CPU usage compared to VMs.

3. Consistency Across Environments: Docker ensures that the application and its dependencies
are packaged together, making it easy to move containers across different environments
(development, testing, production) without worrying about environment-specific issues.

4. Platform Independence: Docker images can run on any system that supports Docker, providing
a consistent environment regardless of the underlying infrastructure (e.g., local machines,
on-premises servers, or cloud platforms).

### Docker Installation (Using the Docker Desktop)
```sh
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
```

### Docker Installation (Online platform)
```sh
https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ # Login using the docker hub
```

### Docker Installation (using ec2)
```sh
How to install docker: (Login as ec2-user)
# Install Docker on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance
sudo yum install docker

# Check the Docker version (note: daemon is not running)
docker version # Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

# Start the Docker service
sudo service docker start

# Enable Docker to start at boot
sudo systemctl enable docker

# List Docker images
docker image ls

# Add the ec2-user to the docker group so you can execute Docker commands without using sudo
# Check group details (confirm docker group exists, and ec2-user is not in the group yet)
cat /etc/group # docker group present and ec2-user does not present to the group

# Add the ec2-user to the Docker group
sudo usermod -G docker ec2-user 

# Verify that the ec2-user is now part of the Docker group
cat /etc/group  # We must see ec2-user belongs to the docker group.

# Logout and login again for group changes to take effect

# List Docker images again, this time without needing sudo
docker image ls

# Run an Ubuntu container in detached and interactive mode
docker run -itd ubuntu

# Alternative solution: allow non-root users to access Docker by modifying socket permissions
sudo chmod  666 /var/run/docker.sock
```
